<p style="color: orangered; background-color: black; font-family: cursive;"> AI means Artificial intelligence; as the name implies Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a machine to replicate or enhance human thinking. Artificial Intelligence has been used in computer program for years but it is now applied to many products and services. Artificial Intelligence technology has become increasing important in the morden world due to its numerous applications and benefits and is quickly changing how we live our lives.</p>

<p style="color: orangered; background-color: black; font-family: cursive; font-size: 30px;">One of the biggest importance of Artificial Intelligence is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision. The decision taken by Artificial Intelligence in every step is the side by information previously gathered, and the certain set of our logrithms when programmed properly. This errors can be reduced.</p>
<p style="color: orangered; background-color: black; font-family: cursive; font-size: 100%"> Another importance of Artificial Intelligence is that human  can overcome many risk by letting robots to do certain works. For instance going to space or exploring the deepest part of the ocean they can do all that without human having to stress themselves. <br/> Then we talk about ECT machines with metal bodies which are resistant to nature  and can survive in enviroments most humans would find unfriendly.</p>

<p style="color: orangered; background-color: black; font-family: cursive; font-style: cursive; font-size: 100%"> But the main question is; <em style="color: cornflowerblue;">"Is AI friend or foe"</em> well it is meant for you to decide.<br/>Firstly Excessive use of AI can bring about laziness. AI has been programmed to perform activities which human beings naturally are supposed to do which includes cleaning, cooking and so on. When all these robots are made availabe to do such, human beings sees no need in putting effort to do such task and that will probably lead to laziness. <br/> AI can also lead to rapid increase in unemployment it tends to be more intelligent, efficient and accurate so that it reduces cost of production and is faster than human this means that <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"why need a human being when a robot can do the job without having to pay a penny to an employee"</i> and this will result to unemployment</p>
